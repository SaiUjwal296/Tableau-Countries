# Analysis of Tuberculosis Data from Various Countries üåç

This project analyzes Tuberculosis (TB) data across various countries using **Tableau**, **SQL**, and **Excel**. The goal is to provide insights into TB trends and patterns worldwide, supporting public health efforts in understanding and mitigating the disease‚Äôs impact.

## Project Overview üìä

This project takes a dataset of Tuberculosis metrics from multiple countries and performs extensive data exploration and analysis, including:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Statistical analysis and visualization
- Country-wise comparison of TB incidence, prevalence, and outcomes over time

By configuring and transforming this data, we can uncover trends and make data-driven insights into Tuberculosis management globally.

## Tools and Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **SQL**: For data extraction, transformation, and cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Excel**: For data manipulation and basic calculations, providing a foundation for additional analysis.
- **Tableau**: To visualize data trends and perform in-depth analysis across countries, identifying correlations and trends effectively.

## Dataset Information üìÇ

- **Source**: The dataset comprises various metrics related to Tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, mortality, and other related health statistics across different countries.
- **Structure**: Each row in the dataset represents data for a specific country and year, including attributes such as country name, year, TB cases, deaths, population, and healthcare variables.

## Analysis Workflow üìã

1. **Data Import and Initial Cleaning**:
   - Imported the dataset into SQL for initial transformations, handling missing values, and optimizing the data structure for analysis.
   - Loaded data into Excel for further cleanup and prepared it for visualization in Tableau.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed TB data trends over time for individual countries and regions.
   - Conducted statistical analysis to identify significant patterns, like changes in TB incidence and mortality rates over time.

3. **Visualization and Insights**:
   - Using Tableau, we created interactive dashboards to visualize TB metrics, country-wise comparisons, and yearly trends.
   - Highlighted critical insights into the factors contributing to TB cases, such as population density, healthcare availability, and regional differences.

## Key Insights and Findings üìà

- **Trends Over Time**: Observed changes in TB incidence and mortality over the years, with some regions showing significant improvements due to enhanced healthcare interventions.
- **Country Comparisons**: Identified countries with the highest and lowest TB rates, examining potential reasons for these differences.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explored correlations between TB rates and factors like healthcare spending and population density.
